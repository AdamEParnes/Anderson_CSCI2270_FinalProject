# Anderson_CSCI2270_FinalProject
## Project Summary
This program expands on the movie tree assignments from class, in which we used red-black binary search trees to organize movies. The user will be able to input the title, release year, rating, and price of each movie via a text file or manually through the program's menu. From the menu the user will also be able to remove movies from the tree, count the number of movies in the tree, search for a specific movie in the tree, and display all of the movies in the tree with their information. The user will be able to sort the movies by each attribute as well, in ascending or descending order.
## How to Run
• Ensure main.cpp, MovieTree.cpp, and MovieTree.h are in the same directory.

• Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory the files are located in.

• Enter "g++ main.cpp MovieTree.cpp MovieTree.h -o Project" to compile the program.

• Enter "./Project" to run the program, with a text file as an optional parameter.
